# How To

# Development

The following tools are required to successfully develop Kraken-rs:

* cargo-make
* cargo-sort

# Contributing

# MSRV

Because upgrading between Rust versions is so smooth, no effort has been
made to maintain the MSRV (minimum supported Rust version). For that reason,
this library runs on stable Rust only.
